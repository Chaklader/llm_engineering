    "Our goal is to code a new kind of Web Browser. Give it a URL, and it will respond with a summary. The Reader's Digest of the internet!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, you should have completed the setup for [PC](../SETUP-PC.md) or [Mac](../SETUP-mac.md) and you hopefully launched this jupyter lab from within the project root directory, with your environment activated.\n",
    "\n",
    "## If you're new to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

    "If you'd prefer to work in VSCode, [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/676f2e19-c228-8012-9911-6ca42f8ed766) are instructions from an AI friend on how to configure it for the course.\n",

    "If you're relatively new to programming -- I've got your back! While it's ideal to have some programming experience for this course, there's only one mandatory prerequisite: plenty of patience. üòÅ I've put together a set of self-study guides that cover Git and GitHub, APIs and endpoints, beginner python and more.\n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

      "Gold has held a unique place in human history as a symbol of value, wealth, and beauty. Its enduring status can be attributed to several interrelated factors encompassing physical properties, cultural significance, and economic systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Physical Properties\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Rarity**: Gold is relatively rare in the Earth's crust. While not the rarest of metals, its availability relative to the demand for ornamentation and wealth storage has bolstered its status.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **Durability**: Gold does not tarnish or corrode. It retains its luster over time, making it an ideal material for jewelry and artifacts that are intended to last through generations, symbolizing eternity and permanence.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Malleability and Ductility**: Gold can be easily shaped and formed into intricate designs. This malleability allows for creativity in jewelry-making and art, reinforcing its association with luxury and aesthetic appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Cultural Significance\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Symbolism of Divinity and Power**: In many ancient cultures, gold was associated with the divine. Egyptian pharaohs were often buried with gold artifacts, as it was believed to facilitate the transition to the afterlife. Similarly, gold has been used in religious artifacts and temples, emphasizing its connection to the sacred.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cultural Artifacts**: Throughout history, gold has been crafted into various cultural symbols, from coins to idols. Its utilization in coins became a standard practice, facilitating trade and indicating value across diverse societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Social Stratification**: Gold often signified status and power. Those who possessed gold were seen as wealthy and influential, creating a societal structure where gold was central to identity and hierarchy.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Economic Systems\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Medium of Exchange**: Gold has historically been used as currency. Its physical properties made it easy to divide and transport, and its intrinsic value allowed it to serve as a reliable medium of exchange in various economic systems, paving the way for modern economic practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Store of Value**: Economically, gold is considered a ‚Äúsafe haven‚Äù asset. Investors often turn to gold in times of economic uncertainty, as its value tends to remain stable or even increase when other financial instruments may falter. This perception reinforces its role in personal and national wealth preservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Standard of Value**: For centuries, many nations operated on a gold standard, where paper currency could be exchanged for a fixed amount of gold. This provided stability and trust in the financial system, further embedding gold‚Äôs significance in economic transactions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Psychological Factors\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Human Aesthetics**: The natural beauty of gold‚Äîits distinctive color, shine, and the way it catches light‚Äîhas captivated humans for millennia. This intrinsic appeal has made it a desirable material for ornamentation and a medium for artistic expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Desire and Value Perception**: The psychological aspects of desire play a role in the valuation of gold. Ownership, prestige, and the aspirational qualities associated with gold induce a collective valuation that is both emotional and economic.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "Gold's value is not arbitrary; it is a complex interplay of physical, cultural, economic, and psychological factors that together create a powerful social construct. Its significance has evolved yet remains remarkably consistent, illustrating humanity's intrinsic relationship with material wealth and beauty. As society advances, the ways we understand and engage with gold may shift, yet its foundational role as a storied symbol of value is likely to endure. This longevity prompts us to reflect on what we consider valuable in our lives, often transcending the material into the philosophical realms of worth, desire, and meaning.\n"
